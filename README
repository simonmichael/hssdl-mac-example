The example program from graphics-drawingcombinators, adapted to also build on on mac OSX.
"make" should build an executable that works on Mac OSX, using hsSDL's recommended workaround.
"cabal install" does not yet, patches welcome.

An example font is provided; to use it, run from the source directory:

 graphics-drawingcombinators-example$ graphics-drawingcombinators-example

Otherwise, specify the path to a .ttf file:

 $ graphics-drawingcombinators-example somefont.ttf
